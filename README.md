# Simple Analog Clock using Python Turtle üï∞Ô∏è

This project is a **real-time analog clock** created using the **Turtle graphics module** in Python. It features a visually appealing clock face, dynamic hands for hours, minutes, and seconds, and interactive graphics that update every second.

## üñ•Ô∏è Demo
The clock dynamically updates based on the current system time, providing a live analog clock display in a window.

## ‚ú® Features
- Real-time clock synchronization with system time.
- Aesthetic design with:
  - Colored hands for hours, minutes, and seconds.
  - Hour and minute markers on the clock face.
  - Numerical labels for all 12-hour positions.
- Lightweight and easy to run on any system with Python installed.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed.
- Turtle module (pre-installed with Python).

### Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/simple-analog-clock.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd simple-analog-clock
   ```

### Running the Project
1. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python analogclock.py
   ```
2. A new window will open displaying the analog clock.

## üõ†Ô∏è Code Overview
### Highlights:
1. **Clock Face**:
   - Outer circular face with distinct markers for hours and minutes.
2. **Dynamic Hands**:
   - Each hand is color-coded:
     - **Green**: Hour hand.
     - **Red**: Minute hand.
     - **Yellow**: Second hand.
3. **Real-Time Update**:
   - Updates every second using the `time` module.
4. **Personalized Design**:
   - Contributors' names displayed on the clock.

### Functions:
- `draw_clock(h, m, s, t)`: The core function that:
  - Draws the clock face.
  - Draws the hour, minute, and second hands based on the input values.
  - Updates dynamically in a loop.

## üì∏ Screenshots
