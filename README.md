# **Simple Analog Clock using Python Turtle 🕰️
This project is a real-time analog clock created using the Turtle graphics module in Python. It features a visually appealing clock face, dynamic hands for hours, minutes, and seconds, and interactive graphics that update every second.

🖥️ Demo
The clock dynamically updates based on the current system time, providing a live analog clock display in a window.

✨ Features
Real-time clock synchronization with system time.
Aesthetic design with:
Colored hands for hours, minutes, and seconds.
Hour and minute markers on the clock face.
Numerical labels for all 12-hour positions.
Lightweight and easy to run on any system with Python installed.
